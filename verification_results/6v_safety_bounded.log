Finished computing initial states: 1548 distinct states generated at 2025-10-17 10:42:12.
Progress(4) at 2025-10-17 10:42:15: 19,209 states generated (19,209 s/min), 11,410 distinct states found (11,410 ds/min), 4,588 states left on queue.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 3.2E-11
50844 states generated, 18384 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 6.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 3 and the 95th percentile is 2).
