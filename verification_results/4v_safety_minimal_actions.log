Finished computing initial states: 336 distinct states generated at 2025-10-17 10:42:02.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 1.1E-12
9392 states generated, 3552 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 6.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 3 and the 95th percentile is 2).
