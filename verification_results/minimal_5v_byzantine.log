Computing initial states...
Finished computing initial states: 1 distinct state generated at 2025-10-17 12:39:19.
Progress(17) at 2025-10-17 12:39:22: 1,144,530 states generated (1,144,530 s/min), 118,812 distinct states found (118,812 ds/min), 35,838 states left on queue.
Model checking completed. No error has been found.
  Estimates of the probability that TLC did not check all reachable states
  because two distinct states had the same fingerprint:
  calculated (optimistic):  val = 7.1E-8
  based on the actual fingerprints:  val = 2.6E-7
4368037 states generated, 322856 distinct states found, 0 states left on queue.
The depth of the complete state graph search is 29.
The average outdegree of the complete state graph is 1 (minimum is 0, the maximum 14 and the 95th percentile is 4).
